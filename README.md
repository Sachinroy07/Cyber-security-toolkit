# Final Ethical Hacking Toolkit

## Summary
This project packages a set of powerful open-source tools for ethical hacking learners into a single installable script. It provides tools for:

- Port Scanning (`nmap`)
- Subdomain Enumeration (`subfinder`, `amass`, `assetfinder`, `crt.sh`)
- Basic Vulnerability Scanning (`nuclei`)
- HTTP probing (`httprobe`)
- Subdomain takeover check (`subzy`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Extract the ZIP
Unzip the file and navigate into the folder.

### 2. Run the installer
```bash
chmod +x install_tools.sh
./install_tools.sh
```

> ⚠️ Note: This script is meant for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu). Run it in a virtual machine or a safe test environment.

## Learning Outcome
This toolkit will allow students to:
- Enumerate subdomains
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Discover open ports
- Check for subdomain takeovers
- Explore recon workflows hands-on
